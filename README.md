VGGNet
 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, it is very accurate in image recognition tasks. VGGNet uses small (3x3) convolution filters, stacked on top of each other in increasing depth similar to the depth of field of a (7x7) layer but with lower parameters. 

Caltech-101
Caltech-101 is a widely used dataset it consists of images from 101 different object categories plus one background category.
